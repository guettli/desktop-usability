desktop usablity
================

my personal point of view.

- enlarging the mouse courso should very easy
- the default action should be visible (for example the button which gets "pressed" if I hit ENTER)
- ctrl-plus ctrl-minus should increase/decrease in every application.


Things which could be improved
==============================

Gimp: Open jpg/png edit it. Save it. Annoying: Gimp wants to force you into is own image format. The gimp developers know it better than I do. They know what's good for me: a lossless image format. No, this is useless. Most average users want to open a jpg/png edit it, and save a jpg/png again. Experts want a lossless data format. The way of the average user should be the default. Experts can handle this their way.


How do I show date next to time in the panel with gnome-shell? https://askubuntu.com/questions/83597/how-do-i-show-date-next-to-time-in-the-panel-with-gnome-shell The current solutions are way too complicated. I want a solution which gets found by a grandma without using google. It should be simple in the spirit of "don't make me think".

double-click on a word should mark the thing in all applications. If I double-click on the "o" in path /blu/foo/bar Firefox does mark "foo". In a gnome-terminal the whole path gets selected. This is annoying. Here is how to fix Firefox double-click behaviour: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Layout.word_select.stop_at_punctuation I think Firefox's default should get fixed. Selecting a file path is very common. Chrome has the same strange default like Firefox.
