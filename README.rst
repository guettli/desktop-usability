desktop usablity
================

my personal point of view.

- enlarging the mouse courso should very easy
- the default action should be visible (for example the button which gets "pressed" if I hit ENTER)
- ctrl-plus ctrl-minus should increase/decrease in every application.


Things which could be improved
==============================

Nautilus images can not be displayed big. Too small for me:

Gimp: Open jpg/png edit it. Save it. Annoying: Gimp wants to force you into is own image format. The gimp developers know it better than I do. They know what's good for me: a lossless image format. No, this is useless. Most average users want to open a jpg/png edit it, and save a jpg/png again. Experts want a lossless data format. The way of the average user should be the default. Experts can handle this their way.
