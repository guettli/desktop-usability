desktop usablity
================

my personal point of view.

- enlarging the mouse courso should very easy
- the default action should be visible (for example the button which gets "pressed" if I hit ENTER)
- ctrl-plus ctrl-minus should increase/decrease in every application.


Things which could be improved
==============================

Nautilus images can not be displayed big. Too small for me:
